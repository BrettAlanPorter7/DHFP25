            <br>
            <h3> Greetings and welcome to my digital humanities webpage!</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Brett Alan Porter, I am a senior computer science student graduating in May 2025.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We offer a range of interactive paths for people to explore different topics and deepen their knowledge of the humanities.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I am not your typical college student, I am pursing my first bachelor's degree at age 36. I struggled with dedication as a student at 18 years old and that continued as I tried to find my way at 22. I eventually dropped out of Governors State University in 2010 when I was put on acadmenic probation. I spent time as a celebrity impersonator/ blackjack dealer for 3 years, followed by sales and warehouse work. I ended up working at a day program for individuals with intellectual disabilities, it was meant to be a temporary job but I found something I was passionate about. I spent 8 years working within this field, working with different ages and different populations. Eventually I decided a return to school was the only way to move forward financially and I settled on computer science as a way to use technology to improve the lives of the others.</p>

            <br>
            <p>In my return to college in 2023 I was determined to do things differently. I got involved in school right away, putting myself in uncomfortable situations as an introvert. I quickly became part of the GovState community and wanted to do my part to make things better for students when I began leadership roles. I have been blessed with opportunities that arose from my hard work. I hope that others can benefit from my story and see the light at the end of the road, knowing that good things can happen for them as well.</p>
