            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <h3> Greetings and welcome to my digital humanities webpage!</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Brett Alan Porter, I am a senior computer science student graduating in May 2025. I am not your typical college student, I am pursing my first bachelor's degree at age 36. I struggled with dedication as a student at 18 years old and that continued as I tried to find my way at 22. I eventually dropped out of Governors State University in 2010 when I was put on acadmenic probation. I spent time as a celebrity impersonator/ blackjack dealer for 3 years, followed by sales and warehouse work. I ended up working at a day program for individuals with intellectual disabilities, it was meant to be a temporary job but I found something I was passionate about. I spent 8 years working within this field, working with different ages and different populations. Without a degree I headed back to school to focus on something new with immense potential but I always knew I would use my new skills to give back to the community of people that gave my life focus and direction.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We offer a range of interactive paths for people to explore different topics and deepen their knowledge of the humanities.</p>
